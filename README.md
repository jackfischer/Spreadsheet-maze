Small experiment with tkinter - this is a maze game where the levels can be designed in an Excel spreadsheet. 

## Features
- Place starting player at any point in grid.
- Board scales to window.
- Select CSV from GUI

## TODO (maybe)
- Add dynamic window resizing
- Add checking for multiple players placed in grid.
- Add "checkpoint/finish" square
- Add progress/save files
